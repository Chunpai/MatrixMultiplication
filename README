Use commmands:
       make
                :- to compile and get the corresponding binary codes 
       
       ./Part_1_navie.out N
                :- N is the matrix size

       ./Part_1_opt.out N
                :- N is the matrix size

       ./Part_2_serial.out Num P
                :- Num is the number SumUpto, P is the number of loop

       ./Part_2_parallel.out Num P
                :- Num is the number SumUpto, P is the number of threads

       ./Part_3_parallel.out N P
                :- N is the matrix size, P is the number of threads

       make clean 
                :- clear all binary codes and matrices files which store in .csv
